# Estudo de Time Series

This project is a study of the course 'Applied Time Series Analysis in Python' hosted at Udemy. In here I discuss a little about the statistical and deep learning approaches, in addition of making an introduction to Prophet.

My codes available here are based on the code tutorial in the course, with some minor additions. Beyond that, the typed materials available here are my own and are not to be reproduced without proper disclousure of the source.
